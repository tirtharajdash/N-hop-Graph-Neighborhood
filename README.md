## N-hop-Graph-Neighborhood

**Problem** 

Given a Graph, *G = (V,E)* (directed or undirected), compute the N-hop neighborhoods of the nodes in a given graph

**Approach**

Nothing magical. Straight-forward exhaustive computation. No attempt is made to make it paralle. However, it is easy to make the
